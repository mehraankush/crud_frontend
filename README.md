# PERFORM CRUD

Welcome to [CRUD](https://crudmehra.netlify.app/) This web application is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for database operations. It enables seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:**
  - The app allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a dataset. Users can add new items, view existing items, update information, and delete items.

- **Responsive and User-Friendly Interface:**
  - The frontend is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.

- **Integration of React.js:**
  - The frontend is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive views, providing a smooth and engaging experience for users.

- **Node.js Server for Backend Logic:**
  - The backend logic and API requests are handled by a Node.js server. This server communicates with the frontend, processes requests, and interacts with the MongoDB database to retrieve or manipulate data.

- **MongoDB Database:**
  - The app uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve data. MongoDB's flexibility allows for efficient storage and retrieval of JSON-like documents, making it well-suited for a variety of applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed locally or a connection to a MongoDB instance.
